# TX23U
La Crosse wind speed and direction Arduino interface library

Based on https://www.john.geek.nz/2012/08/la-crosse-tx23u-anemometer-communication-protocol/

Forked from https://github.com/egzumer/Arduino-LaCrosse-TX23-Library/blob/master/LaCrosse_TX23.cpp

This library reads both first **and second(*)** datagrams, the first contained exponential or moving average wind speed values, with 10 to 20 second time constant, the second containing wind gust peak values over the last 10 or 20 seconds.

LaCrosse TX23 is a wind speed and direction sensor. It uses 3 wires for communication and power:
```
Pin1 - Brown(Black) - DATA
Pin2 - Red - Vcc (3.3V works, don't know if 5V OK)
Pin3 - Green - N/C
Pin4 - Yellow - GND
```
DATA pin is to be connected directly to one of Arduino digital input pins, with **external 10K pullup** to Vcc.

(*) See comments in https://www.john.geek.nz/2012/08/la-crosse-tx23u-anemometer-communication-protocol/

Logic analyzer capture of a valid TX23U transmission showing the two back-to-back datagrams. In this case the wind speed and gust speed are both zero, so the two datagrams have are identical values. The "double hump" is the start sequence of each data frame.
